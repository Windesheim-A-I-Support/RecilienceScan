[Try it out on RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/content/4370280) --- [Read the documentation](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/quarto_titlepages/)

This repo includes a Quarto extension and templates for making a custom title page or book cover using the information in the YAML (from the `xyz.qmd` for an single doc and from `index.qmd` for a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) book).

## Install the extension

```bash
quarto use template nmfs-opensci/quarto-titlepages
```

This will install the extension in the `_extension` folder plus all the demo files. Essentially, you will be cloning the repo into a new folder and you will be asked at installation for the name of the (empty) folder/directory that you want to install into.

## Install for an existing document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. This will install only the files in the `_extension` folder and will not install the files above that (the demo files).

From the quarto project or document directory, run the following command:

```bash
quarto install extension nmfs-opensci/quarto-titlepages
```

## Usage

In your document yaml add the format and a titlepage theme.

```yaml
format: titlepage-pdf
titlepage: great-wave
```

Then render the document. See the documentation for the possible themes.

## Customizing

In the `demo` folder of the repo, you will find an example of using Pandoc templates when rendering a pdf. Read the documentation to get oriented or skim the code and it should be apparent how it works.

If you want to customize one of the title page themes, you will find tex files for each of the title and cover page examples in the `_extensions` folder, *e.g.*, `_vline_titlepage.tex`.
The folder also contains a `theme.lua` filter that sets up the metadata so that the Pandoc template in `before-body.tex` chooses the right title page theme and cover based on `titlepage: ` in the YAML. You do not have to use the extension when customizing. You can just copy and paste the relevent LaTeX code, from say one of the `..._titlepage.tex` files, into `demo/_titlepage.tex` and use the `article.qmd` file in the `demo` folder.

See the documentation for more information on customizing.
