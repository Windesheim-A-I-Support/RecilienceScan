  A reproducible, researcher-friendly pipeline that accepts cleaned CSV files, validates them, generates **branded PDF reports** using Quarto + LaTeX, and sends them via Outlook email with logging for traceability.

- **Long-Term Vision:**  
  Transition from today‚Äôs manual Power BI/Excel exports into a **fully open-source survey infrastructure** where surveys can be:  
  1. **Designed** in open-source survey tools.  
  2. **Published** on the web.  
  3. **Collected** into a secure, open database.  
  4. **Validated & Transformed** automatically.  
  5. **Reported** via Quarto into branded outputs.  
  6. **Delivered** automatically to respondents and stakeholders.  
  7. **Archived** for reproducibility and deeper research analysis.  

This objective ensures **trust, efficiency, and reproducibility** in reporting workflows while aligning with Windesheim and VCH‚Äôs broader push toward **open science** and **EU-aligned compliance**.

## üß¨ Motivation & Methodology
<!-- Academic/research gap addressed, objectives, hypotheses, methodology summary. Reference any related papers or datasets. -->

### Motivation
The current workflow for generating Resilience Reports is **manual, error-prone, and difficult to reproduce**:  
- Data is exported from Power BI/Excel and manually cleaned.  
- Reports are created by hand, leading to inconsistent formatting and branding.  
- Distribution relies on manual email attachments, which introduces risk and wastes researcher time.  

Researchers, stakeholders, and institutions need a **reliable, auditable, and automated system** that ensures:  
- **Efficiency** ‚Äî less time spent on repetitive formatting and distribution.  
- **Consistency** ‚Äî reports always follow institutional branding and design standards.  
- **Trust** ‚Äî outputs are validated and traceable back to their source data.  
- **Reproducibility** ‚Äî the entire process can be replicated by any researcher, not just the original developer.  

### Methodology
This project applies a **stepwise, milestone-driven approach** to build up from manual reproducibility to full automation:  

1. **Baseline (M1):** Automate report generation and delivery from cleaned CSVs using Quarto + Outlook.  
2. **Incremental Automation (M2‚ÄìM4):** Introduce scripted validation, CI/CD reproducibility checks, and event-driven delivery pipelines.  
3. **Survey Pipeline Integration (M5‚ÄìM6):** Transition from Excel/Power BI exports into open-source survey tools (e.g., Formbricks, LimeSurvey) with direct data ingestion.  
4. **Full Open-Source Pipeline:** Surveys designed, published, validated, reported, and delivered end-to-end with storage for long-term analysis.  

The methodology emphasizes:  
- **Open-source tools** (Quarto, LaTeX, R/Python, survey platforms).  
- **Researcher usability** (installer scripts, documentation, acceptance tests).  
- **Validation & auditability** (schema checks, logs, traceability).  
- **Scalability & governance** (institutional branding, EU compliance alignment).

## üîé Project Need

### Pain Points in the Current Workflow
- **Manual effort:** Reports require exporting from Power BI, cleaning in Excel, formatting, and emailing ‚Äî all by hand.  
- **Inconsistency:** Branding and layout differ between researchers, reducing professional appearance and trust.  
- **Fragility:** Knowledge of how to build the reports is tacit and not documented ‚Äî if a researcher leaves, the workflow breaks.  
- **Risk of errors:** Copy-paste steps and manual attachments create opportunities for mistakes.  
- **Limited reproducibility:** Results cannot easily be replicated on a different machine or by a new team member.  

### Institutional Context
- **Windesheim University & VCH (Value Chain Hackers):**  
  Require reproducible, trustworthy reporting pipelines that scale beyond one researcher‚Äôs laptop.  
- **EU Compliance & Open Science:**  
  Projects increasingly need to demonstrate **traceability, reproducibility, and transparency** (e.g., CSRD, CSDDD, EUDR).  
- **Research Infrastructure Gap:**  
  Many research groups rely on fragile, manual tools (Excel, Power BI) ‚Äî this project fills the gap with open-source infrastructure.  

### Why This Project is Needed
- **Empower researchers:** Any researcher should be able to generate and send validated, branded reports independently.  
- **Ensure continuity:** The process must survive beyond individuals and be documented for handover.  
- **Save time:** Automating repetitive steps frees researchers to focus on analysis, not formatting.  
- **Increase trust:** Consistent branding, validated data, and logged deliveries strengthen credibility with external stakeholders.  
- **Enable scalability:** Creates the foundation for a fully open-source survey pipeline, ready for more advanced automation and integration.

## üí° Use Cases

### Current Use Case
Today, generating a Resilience Report requires:  
1. Exporting survey results from Power BI into Excel.  
2. Manually cleaning and saving the data as a CSV file.  
3. Formatting results into a report by hand.  
4. Attaching and sending the report via Outlook.  

**Problems this creates:**  
- Time-consuming and repetitive.  
- Reports differ in look and feel depending on who creates them.  
- High risk of errors in copy-pasting or attaching the wrong file.  
- Not reproducible by a new researcher without personal guidance.  

---

### Ultimate Vision Use Case
The long-term goal is a **fully open-source survey pipeline**:  
1. **Survey Design:** Researchers design a new survey using open-source survey tools.  
2. **Publication:** The survey is published online for participants to access.  
3. **Data Collection:** Responses are collected automatically into an open database.  
4. **Validation & Transformation:** Responses are validated and cleaned automatically, ensuring quality and reliability.  
5. **Report Generation:** Quarto + LaTeX produce branded PDF/HTML reports, including validation summaries.  
6. **Automated Delivery:** Reports are automatically emailed to respondents and stakeholders, integrated into existing workflows (e.g., Outlook).  
7. **Archival & Analysis:** Reports and raw data are archived for reproducibility and available for deeper, longitudinal analysis.  

**Benefits of this vision:**  
- No manual intervention needed.  
- Reports always branded and validated.  
- Full transparency and traceability from survey ‚Üí report ‚Üí delivery.  
- Scales easily for new surveys, larger datasets, and multiple researchers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Proposal

### Ingestion
- **Current (M1):**  
  Researchers manually export from Power BI/Excel and save a cleaned CSV into the `data/` folder.  
- **Near-Term (M4):**  
  Script or n8n flow checks the WordPress site for new files, downloads them if updated, and places them in the correct folder.  
- **Long-Term (M5‚ÄìM6):**  
  Direct integration with open-source survey platforms (e.g., Formbricks, LimeSurvey) feeding responses into structured storage.


### Validation & Transformation
- **Schema Validation:**  
  A lightweight script (Python or R) ensures required columns, formats, and ranges are correct.  
- **Business Rules:**  
  Additional checks (e.g., minimum sample size, plausible value ranges, trend sanity checks).  
- **Error Handling:**  
  Fail-fast with clear messages and ‚Äúhow to fix‚Äù guidance. Validation log stored in `logs/`.

### Reporting
- **Renderer:** Quarto CLI with TinyTeX installed locally.  
- **Templates:** Branded `.qmd` templates using Windesheim/VCH title pages, fonts, and styling.  
- **Outputs:**  
  - Branded PDFs (primary).  
  - Optional HTML for previews or interactive reports.  
- **Packaging:**  
  Naming conventions ensure per-recipient reports are identifiable (e.g., `reports/2025Q3_companyname.pdf`).


### Delivery
- **Current (M1):**  
  Python script sends PDFs via Outlook using the researcher‚Äôs existing email profile.  
- **Future:**  
  - n8n SMTP node for automation.  
  - Delivery confirmation and retry logic.  
  - Optional multiple channels (e.g., Teams, Slack, or secure links).


### Storage & Archival
- **Current:**  
  - `reports/` holds all generated PDFs.  
  - `logs/` tracks validation results and email delivery.  
- **Future:**  
  - Database (Postgres + Supabase) or object storage (S3/MinIO) for durability and long-term analysis.  
  - Metadata (input hash ‚Üí report hash ‚Üí delivery log) enables traceability.

### Orchestration
- **Current (M1):**  
  Step-by-step execution documented in README (`validate ‚Üí render ‚Üí send`).  
- **Future:**  
  - n8n flows to watch sources, trigger validation, reporting, delivery, and archival.  
  - GitHub Actions to run acceptance tests on a sample CSV and store a test PDF as artifact.  
  - Scheduling (cron/n8n) for periodic runs or event-driven triggers.  


### Guiding Principles
- **Reproducibility:** Entire pipeline must work on a clean VM with no hidden dependencies.  
- **Open Source First:** Prefer open-source tools over proprietary automation.  
- **Researcher-Friendly:** Simple commands, installer scripts, and documentation.  
- **Traceability:** Every report linked back to its source data, with logs for audit.

### Recipients Mapping (`config/recipients.csv`)
\\```
company,email
Acme Ltd,reports@acme.com
Beta BV,ops@beta.example
Gamma GmbH,info@gamma.de
\\```

- Used by `send_email.py` to route the correct report to the correct recipient.  
- Each row must correspond to a company present in the CSV data.

---

### Validation Schema (`config/schema.json`)
Defines required columns and expected types. Example:  
\\```json
{
  "columns": {
    "company": "string",
    "period": "string",
    "score_total": "number",
    "n_responses": "integer"
  },
  "constraints": {
    "score_total": {"min": 0, "max": 100},
    "n_responses": {"min": 5}
  }
}
\\```

---

### Business Rules (`config/rules.yml`)
Captures additional checks not enforced by schema. Example:  
\\```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Minimum responses per company"
    field: "n_responses"
    condition: ">= 5"
    message: "At least 5 responses required per company."
  - name: "Score within range"
    field: "score_total"
    condition: "0 <= value <= 100"
    message: "Score must be between 0 and 100."
\\```
