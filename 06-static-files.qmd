# Using static title and cover pages

## title page

If you have a static LaTeX title page, then pass in 

```
titlepage: your_titlepage.tex
```
The file should contain only the TeX for the title page. Its contents will be input as follows
```
\begin{titlepage}
\input{your_titlepage.tex}
\end{titlepage}
```
Note because the `\input{}` call happens after the Pandoc template code is evaluated, this file must be a static tex file with no Pandoc meta variables.

## Cover page

Similarly, if you have a static LaTeX cover page, then pass in 

```
coverpage: your_coverpage.tex
```
The file should contain only the TeX for the title page. Its contents will be input as
```
\begin{titlepage}
\input{your_coverpage.tex}
\clearpage
... 
\end{titlepage}
```
