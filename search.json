    "text": "The extension provides a format titlepage-pdf where you can specify a variety of themes and customizations.\n\n\n\n\nquarto use template nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages\nThis will install the extension in the _extension folder plus all the demo files. Essentially, you will be cloning the repo into a new folder and you will be asked at installation for the name of the (empty) folder/directory that you want to install into.\n\n\n\nYou may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. This will install only the files in the _extension folder and will not install the files above that (the demo files).\nFrom the quarto project or document directory, run the following command:\nquarto install extension nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages\n\n\n\n\nIn your document yaml add the format and a title page theme (or file). For example,\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    titlepage: vline\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n    number-sections: true\nFor a cover page, you would add something like\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    coverpage: true\n    cover-bg-image: \"myimage.jpeg\"\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n    number-sections: true\nThis would default to cover page with a full-page background image and the title at top and author at bottom, but all of that is customizable.\nThen render the document. How? That depends on the IDE you are using. There should be a render ‘button’ or drop-down or you can run this command from the shell.\nquarto render article.qmd\nassuming your qmd file is named article.qmd.\n\n\n\nAll features of the text and placement of blocks (header, title, author, etc) are customizable. See the chapters on themes and customizing. Jump to the pages on the title page themes and cover page themes to see examples.\nNeed to add a copyright or dedication page after the title page? See section on adding static files.\n\n\n\nThe document class changes the look of your document. For the book document classes, you will need to pass in\nnumber-sections: true\nin your YAML because Quarto sets number-sections: false by default and that will mess up all your equation, figure and table numbers. It simple will not number them correctly at all.\n\n\nThe KOMA scrbook document class has many options that your can use to change the look of your book. Read the documentation here.\nIf you want chapters to be allowed to start on even or odd pages and the left and right margins on even and odd pages to be the same, use\nclassoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n\n\n\nThis document class is more for single documents with sections and the equation, figure and table numbering will be 1, 2, 3, … as opposed to 1.1, 1.2, etc, with the chapter number included in the number. The default in Quarto is no section or chapter numbers. Use\nnumber-sections: true\nif you want numbers.\n\n\n\nThe cls folder has some other document classes that you can use. Specify by providing the path to the document class file. For example,\ndocumentclass: cls/krantz.cls\nThe base TeX document classes are article, report, and book. But there are many many more available to customize the look of your document. Here is a Stackoverflow post with a few discusssed here.\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a table of contents (toc: true), list of figures (lof: true) and list of tables (lot: true). The depth of the TOC is specified with toc-depth. Example:\nformat:\n  titlepage-pdf:\n    titlepage: bg-image\n    documentclass: scrartcl\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 3\n    lof: true\n    lot: true"

Include only the tex, no \\begin{document} or similar.\n\n###coverpage-title\nPass this in if you want the title to be different than what is in the main yaml.\n###coverpage-author\nPass this in if you want the title to be different than what is in the main yaml. For example, just last names or initials plus last name.\n###coverpage-bg-image\nThe background image file. Default is to make this fill the whole page. You can change the size and place the image using bg-image-left and bg-image-bottom to specify distance from left and bottom of the page.\n\nAn image file\n\n\n\n\nSome text for the header. Note “header” doesn’t mean it has to be at the top. You can place your elements however you want using the distance from the bottom of the page, e.g. \n  coverpage-theme:\n    header-left: 1in\n    header-bottom: 1in\nputs the header in the lower left corner, 1 inch from the left and bottom.\n\n\n\nSome text for the footer. Note “footer” doesn’t mean it has to be at the bottom. That is just the default. You can place your elements however you want using the distance from the bottom of the page, e.g. \n  coverpage-theme:\n    footer-bottom: 10in\n\n\n\n\nThe cover page has the following elements: page, title, author, header, footer, bg-image. Each of these can be customized via the coverpage-theme.\nExample:\n    coverpage-theme: \n      page-html-color: \"c4c4c4\" # html color\n      title-style: \"plain\"\n      title-fontfamily: \"Palatino\"\n      title-fontstyle: [\"Huge\", \"bfseries\"]\n      title-align: left\n      title-location-bottom: \"0.5\\\\paperheight\"\n      title-location-left: 1in\n\n\nThe page color as an html color; leave off the leading #.\n\n\n\nFor title, author, header, footer, date, these can be\n\nplain\nnone the element won’t be shown at all\n\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date.\nDo not use both page-html-color and page-color. Choose one. page-color will use names. What names are available? Google latex xcolor. Standard color names.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date.\nThe fontfamily can be specified for the page and will be used for all the elements unless you pass in an element specific font family, like title-fontfamily. The font family can be a name that you have in your font library or it can be a font file. You can download lots of different font files. The is the most surefire way to get your fonts to work.\nThe extension has an example font file: QTDublinIrish.otf and the extension has the Qualitype fonts. To use these, specify your font as _extensions/nmfs-opensci/titlepage/fonts/qualitype/opentype/<font-file-name>. To use other font files, you can download a font file from the LaTeX Font Catalogue. The otf (opentype) and ttf files should work. Some fonts will have font styling like “bold” so you will need to use the font file with the styling you want. Or you probably can download the folder with regular, italic etc files and pass in the font directory name. Note not all fonts have all styling. For example, small caps (textsc) is only available for some fonts.\nI have fonts on my machine but Quarto can’t find them! Good luck. Stackoverflow will hopefully help you. Fonts that cannot be found is a source of much TeX misery. Using font files that you specify directly avoids this problem.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, header, footer, date.\nThis is a list of styles to add. [\"tiny\", \"textit\"] would be tiny size italic text. It needs to be styles that LaTeX knows; don’t add \\ to the name. Sizes: tiny, small, normal, large, Large, LARGE, huge, Huge. Styles: “textsc”, “textit”, “textbf”, “uppercase”, “lowercase”, “bfseries”. Are common ones.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date. Note, this will be ignored if you pass in a font size (like \"large\") in -fontfamily.\nThe font size in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date.\nThe spacing between lines if text runs into multiple lines. Specify in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number. If you only specify fontsize, it will use 1.2 fontsize as the spacing.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date, logo.\nThe page alignment: left, right or center. For title, subtitle, author, header, and footer, you can also specify spread and it will spread the text across the whole page.\n\n\n\nAvailable for bg-image, title, author, header, footer, date, logo.\nHow much (in degrees) to rotate the element.\n\n\n\nFor title, author, header, footer, date, logo.\nDistance from the left side of page to the left side of element (align = left) or right side of page to the right side of element (align = right). Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperwidth\" or \"0.9\\\\textwidth\".\n\n\n\nAvailable for bg-image, title, author, header, footer, date, logo.\nDistance from the bottom of page to the bottom of element. Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperheight\" or \"0.9\\\\textheight\".\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, header, footer, date.\nWidth of the box that holds the text. Smaller will mean that the text is wrapped. Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperwidth\" or \"0.9\\\\textwidth\".\n*If you pass in -left for an element, you must also pass in -width for that element. Since you can pass in widths in any units, there is no way to compute a width for you.\n\n\n\nDistance from the left side of page to the left side of image. Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperwidth\" or \"0.9\\\\textwidth\".\n\n\n\nThe background image width. Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperwidth\" or \"0.9\\\\textwidth\".\n\n\n\nThe transparency of the background image.\n\n\n\nSide to fade of the image. Can be “top”, “north”, “bottom”, “south”, “right”, “east”, “left”, “west”, “fadeout”\n\n\n\n\nThese are features that you can customize. If you leave it out, it will either not set the value (so use whatever defaults LaTeX has) or will choose a theme specific default.

Default is true (which is the same as plain). false (or none) would stop the title page being generated at all. Note although titlepage specifies the overall theme, all features can be changed by passing a new value in titlepage-theme; see below.\n\nnone or false no title page\ntrue (or plain): minimal styling. Everything on the page is left-aligned, with title, subtitle, author with affiliation superscripts, and affiliations in a numbered list.

You can pass in a static tex file for the title page. Include only the tex, no \\begin{document} or similar.\n\n\n\n\nThe logo for the title page. It doesn’t use logo from the main yaml.\n###titlepage-bg-image\nThe background image file. Default is to make this fill the whole page. See the bg-image theme for how to put this in the top-left corner and make smaller. You can tile the image too.\n\n\n\nSome text for the header. Note “header” doesn’t mean it has to be at the top. You can order your elements however you want using the elements in titlepage-theme.\n\n\n\nSome text for the footer. Note “footer” doesn’t mean it has to be at the bottom. That is just the default. You can order your elements however you want.\n\n\n\nThis sets the margins for the text area. If you have a background image in a top corner for example, you need to pass this in to shift the text area down so it doesn’t overlap your image.\ntitlepage-geometry: [\"top=3in\", \"bottom=1in\", \"right=1in\", \"left=1in\"]\n\n\n\n\nThe title page has the following elements: page, title, subtitle, author, header, footer, logo, vline, bg-image. Each of these can be customized via titlepage-theme.\nExample:\n    titlepage-theme: \n      page-html-color: \"c4c4c4\" \n      title-style: \"plain\"\n      title-fontfamily: \"Palatino\"\n      title-fontstyle: [\"Huge\", \"bfseries\"]\n      title-align: left\n      title-space-after: 1in\n\n\nWhat elements do you want to appear and in what order? You can also add text to add between the elements. The element names are \\\\titleblock, \\\\authorblock, \\\\affiliationblock, \\\\headerblock, \\\\footerblock, \\\\dateblock, \\\\logoblock.\nAn example specification would be\n    titlepage-theme: \n      elements: [\"\\\\logoblock\", \"\\\\authorblock\", \"\\\\vfill\", \"\\\\titleblock\", \"Some text at the bottom\"] \nThis puts the logo at the top, followed by the author block, then some stretchable space followed by the title and some text. Basically in the tex file this will appear like\n\\logoblock\n\\vspace{logo-space-after}\n\\authorblock\n\\vspace{author-space-after}\n\\vfill\n\\titleblock\n\\vspace{title-space-after}\nSome text at the bottom\nKnowing this, you can see how you might include things like horizontal lines and any text with TeX formatting in your title page. The alignment of Some text at the bottom will be governed by page-align in this case.\n\n\n\nThe page color as an html color; leave off the leading #.\n\n\n\nFor title, header, footer, date, these can be\n\nplain no lines or boxes around element\ndoubleline a line on the top and bottom\ncolorbox element in a a color filled box\nnone the element won’t be shown at all\n\nFor author-style, these can be\n\nplain authors listed with author-sep as separation.\nplain-with-and same as plain but the last two authors will be separated with and\nsuperscript like plain but superscripts for affiliations\nsuperscript-with-and like plain-with-and but superscripts for affiliations\nauthor-address each author on a separate line with address(es)\n\nNote author-sep: \"newline\" will give each author on a new line. If you want to specify the character separating authors in a list, keep in mind that Pandoc strips all preceeding and following whitespace. So to specify \" -- \" as the separation you need to use \"\\ --\\ \".\nFor affiliation-style, these can be\n\nnumbered-list each affiliation gets a number on a new line\nnumbered-list-with-correspondence add a line for the corresponding author.\n\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nDo not use both page-html-color and page-color. Choose one. page-color will use names. What names are available? Google latex xcolor. Standard color names.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nThe fontfamily can be specified for the page and will be used for all the elements unless you pass in an element specific font family, like title-fontfamily. The font family can be a name that you have in your font library or it can be a font file. You can download lots of different font files. The is the most surefire way to get your fonts to work.\nThe extension has an example font file: QTDublinIrish.otf and the extension has the Qualitype fonts. To use these, specify your font as _extensions/nmfs-opensci/titlepage/fonts/qualitype/opentype/<font-file-name>. To use other font files, you can download a font file from the LaTeX Font Catalogue. The otf (opentype) and ttf files should work. Some fonts will have font styling like “bold” so you will need to use the font file with the styling you want. Or you probably can download the folder with regular, italic etc files and pass in the font directory name. Note not all fonts have all styling. For example, small caps (textsc) is only available for some fonts.\nI have fonts on my machine but Quarto can’t find them! Good luck. Stackoverflow will hopefully help you. Fonts that cannot be found is a source of much TeX misery. Using font files that you specify directly avoids this problem.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nThis is a list of styles to add. [\"tiny\", \"textit\"] would be tiny size italic text. It needs to be styles that LaTeX knows; don’t add \\ to the name. Sizes: tiny, small, normal, large, Large, LARGE, huge, Huge. Styles: “textsc”, “textit”, “textbf”, “uppercase”, “lowercase”, “bfseries”. Are common ones.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date. Note, this will be ignored if you pass in a font size (like \"large\") in -fontfamily.\nThe font size in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number, like title-fontsize: 20.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nThe spacing between lines if text runs into multiple lines. Specify in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number like title-spacing: 24. If you only specify fontsize, it will use 1.2 fontsize as the spacing.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date, logo.\nThe page alignment: left, right or center. For title, subtitle, author, header, and footer, you can also specify spread and it will spread the text across the whole page.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, affiliation, header, footer, date, logo.\nHow much space to add after the element. Can be in, cm, mm, pt or percent of paper or text, e.g. 0.5\\\\textheight. Note, in elements, you can have a \\\\vfill somewhere if you want the text spread fully from top to bottom. Like so\ntitlepage-theme:\n  elements: [\"\\\\titleblock\", \"\\\\vfill\", \"\\\\logoblock\"]\nNote that you need title-space-after to not be set to 0 for \\vfill to work here. It’s a quirk of LaTeX that for \\vfill to work, you have to have a \\vspace{} line and title-space-after will be translated to \\vspace{title-space-after} in the TeX file. By default, all the elements have a non-zero space-after, so you shouldn’t run into trouble unless you were to set title-space-after: 0 here.\n\n\n\nSpace to add between the title and subtitle.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, header, footer, date.\nIf -style is colorbox, you can specify the colorbox features:\n\n-colorbox-fill fill color\n-colorbox-borderwidth width of the border (in, cm, mm, pt)\n-colorbox-bordercolor border color\n\n\n\n\nThe background image size. Specify this with units like in, cm, mm, pt or as a fraction of the paper or text like 0.5\\\\paperwidth.\n\n\n\nWhere to pin the image. Can be\n\nURCorner upper right corner\nULCorner upper left corner`\nLRCorner lower right corner\nLLCorner lower left corner\nTileSquare tile the image\n\n\n\n\nAdd a fade to the image. Can be\n\ntop, north top of image\nleft, west left side of image\nright, east right side of image\nbottom, south bottom of image\nfadeout fade out in a circle starting from center\n\n\n\n\nThe vertical rule specifications are\n\nvrule-width the width as in, cm, mm, pt (e.g. “1cm”) or a fraction of the paper or text like \"0.1\\\\textwidth\".\nvrule-color names of colors. It’s the xcolors.\nvrule-align left, right, leftright. The latter makes a rule on both sides.\nvrule-space-after the gap between the vertical rule and the text\nvrule-text text to put in the vertical rule\nvrule-text-color color of the text\nvrule-text-style text styles. See above on what styles are possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are features that you can customize. If you leave it out, it will either not set the value (so use whatever defaults LaTeX has) or will choose a theme specific default.
