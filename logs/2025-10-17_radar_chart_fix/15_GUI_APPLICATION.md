## Installation

### Quick Start:

```bash
cd /home/chris/Documents/github/RecilienceScan

# Make launcher executable
chmod +x launch_gui.sh

# Launch (with system checks)
./launch_gui.sh
```

### Manual Start:

```bash
# Run system check first
python3 gui_system_check.py

# If all good, launch GUI
python3 ResilienceScanGUI.py
```

---

## Files Summary

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| ResilienceScanGUI.py | ~35 KB | Main GUI application |
| gui_system_check.py | ~12 KB | System validation |
| launch_gui.sh | ~1 KB | Safe launcher |
| GUI_README.md | ~15 KB | User documentation |
| gui_log.txt | Variable | Application log |

---

## Integration with Existing System

### Unchanged:
- ✅ ResilienceReport.qmd
- ✅ ExecutiveDashboard.qmd
- ✅ generate_all_reports.py
- ✅ send_email.py
- ✅ clean_data.py
- ✅ All data files
- ✅ All generated PDFs

### New:
- ✅ ResilienceScanGUI.py
- ✅ gui_system_check.py
- ✅ launch_gui.sh
- ✅ GUI_README.md
- ✅ gui_log.txt (created on first run)

### How It Works:
The GUI **wraps** existing scripts, it doesn't replace them:
- Calls `generate_all_reports.py` for generation
- Calls `send_email.py` for emails
- Reads from same data files
- Uses same templates
- Outputs to same folders

**Benefits:**
- Scripts still work independently
- GUI adds convenience layer
- No breaking changes
- Easy to maintain
