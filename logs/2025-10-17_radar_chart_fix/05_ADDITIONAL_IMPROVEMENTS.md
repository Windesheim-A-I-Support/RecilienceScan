## Issue: Multiple People Per Company

### Problem Description

Some companies have multiple people who filled out the survey (e.g., Scania Logistics NL has 13 entries). The original dashboard didn't show which specific person's responses were being used for the radar charts.

**User Request:**
> "There are several people working in the same company. Can you add the name of the person that filled it in so I can check?"

---

## Solution Implemented

### Change 1: Extract Person Information from CSV

**File:** `example_3.qmd`
**Location:** Lines 1407-1419 (dashboard-setup block)

**Added Code:**
```r
# Extract additional person details (function/role and submit date)
person_function <- ""
submit_date <- ""
if (!is.null(dashboard_data) && data_source == "real") {
  if ("function" %in% colnames(dashboard_data)) {
    person_function <- as.character(dashboard_data[1, "function"])
    if (is.na(person_function)) person_function <- ""
  }
  if ("submitdate" %in% colnames(dashboard_data)) {
    submit_date <- as.character(dashboard_data[1, "submitdate"])
    if (is.na(submit_date)) submit_date <- ""
  }
}
```

**Why bracket notation `dashboard_data[1, "function"]`:**
- `function` is a reserved word in R
- Cannot use `dashboard_data$function` (causes parse error)
- Bracket notation safely accesses the column

### Change 2: Display Person Info in Dashboard Header

**File:** `example_3.qmd`
**Location:** Lines 1577-1585

**Before:**
```markdown
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### **`r company_name`** - SCRES: **`r sprintf("%.2f", overall_score)`**/5.00

`r if (nchar(person_name) > 0) paste("Contact:", person_name)`

*NextGenResilience • RUG • Windesheim • Involvation*
:::
```

**After:**
```markdown
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### **`r company_name`** - SCRES: **`r sprintf("%.2f", overall_score)`**/5.00

`r if (nchar(person_name) > 0) { if (nchar(person_function) > 0) paste("Respondent:", person_name, "-", person_function) else paste("Respondent:", person_name) }`

`r if (nchar(submit_date) > 0) paste("Survey Date:", submit_date)`

*NextGenResilience • RUG • Windesheim • Involvation*
:::
```

**What this displays:**
- **Respondent:** [Name] - [Function/Role]
- **Survey Date:** [Date]

**Example output:**
- `Respondent: Pim Jansen - SC & Procurement Director`
- `Survey Date: 11/18/2022`

## Additional Improvement: Removed Detailed Gap Analysis

### User Request:
> "Can you remove the 'detailed gap analysis'?"

### Change: Removed Section

**File:** `example_3.qmd`
**Location:** Originally lines 1720-1782

**Removed:**
- Entire "Gedetailleerde Gap Analyse" / "Detailed Gap Analysis" section
- 3 cards showing Upstream/Internal/Downstream gap analysis
- High/low examples for each dimension

**Reason for Removal:**
- User feedback: Section not needed
- Simplifies report
- Reduces page count

**What remains:**
- Main dashboard with 4 radar charts
- Executive summary with performance level
- Strongest/weakest pillar information

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Suplacon (Single Entry)

**Command:**
```bash
quarto render example_3.qmd -P company="Suplacon" --to pdf --output test_Suplacon_v2.pdf
```

**Expected Output in PDF:**
- Respondent: Pim Jansen - SC & Procurement Director
- Survey Date: 11/18/2022

**Result:** ✅ PASS

**File:** `reports/test_Suplacon_v2.pdf` (39KB)

### Test 2: Scania Logistics NL (13 Entries)

**Command:**
```bash
quarto render example_3.qmd -P company="Scania Logistics NL" --to pdf
```

**Expected Output in PDF:**
- Respondent: Elbrich de Jong (0.1) - Supply Chain Manager
- Survey Date: 11/18/2022
- (First person in database for this company)

**Result:** ✅ PASS

**File:** `reports/test_Scania.pdf` (39KB)

**Note:** System correctly picks the FIRST entry when multiple people exist for same company.

## How Multiple Entries Are Handled

### Current Behavior:

1. **Data Loading:** Loads `cleaned_master.csv`
2. **Company Match:** Finds first row matching company name
3. **Person Extraction:** Takes person info from that FIRST row
4. **Display:** Shows "Respondent: [Name] - [Function]"

### For Companies with Multiple Entries:

**Example: Scania Logistics NL**
- Has 13 survey responses
- System uses FIRST entry: Elbrich de Jong
- Other responses (Aafke Christenhusz, Arjan Muntenga, etc.) are NOT used
- Report clearly shows whose responses are displayed

### Future Enhancement (If Needed):

If you want to:
- Show ALL responses for a company
- Average multiple responses
- Generate separate reports per person

You would need to modify `generate_all_reports.py` to:
1. Loop through ALL entries per company
2. Pass both `company` and `person` parameters
3. Generate one PDF per person

**Example:**
```python
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    company = row['company_name']
    person = row['name']
    # Generate report with both parameters
```

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Change | Lines Modified |
|------|--------|----------------|
| example_3.qmd | Added person info extraction | +12 lines (1407-1419) |
| example_3.qmd | Updated dashboard header | Modified (1577-1585) |
| example_3.qmd | Removed gap analysis section | -62 lines (deleted 1720-1782) |

## Benefits

1. **Clarity:** Now clear whose responses are shown
2. **Traceability:** Can verify which person's data is in the report
3. **Multi-person handling:** When company has multiple entries, shows which one is used
4. **Cleaner report:** Removed unnecessary gap analysis section

---

## Next Steps

If you want to generate reports for ALL people in a company:

1. Modify `generate_all_reports.py`:
   ```python
   for idx, row in df.iterrows():
       company = row['company_name']
       person = safe_filename(row['name'])
       output_file = f"{company}_{person}.pdf"
       # Render with both parameters
   ```

2. This would create:
   - `Scania_Logistics_NL_Elbrich_de_Jong.pdf`
   - `Scania_Logistics_NL_Aafke_Christenhusz.pdf`
   - `Scania_Logistics_NL_Arjan_Muntenga.pdf`
   - etc.
