Project: ResilienceScan Web Interface Polish and Usability Enhancement
Workspace: .auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/002-p4-resiliencescan-web-interface
Started: 2026-02-07

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Enhancing existing web interface functionality with usability improvements, error handling, and visual polish while maintaining current architecture and functionality

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json with 8 phases and 25 subtasks
- Created project_index.json with web service configuration
- Created context.json with patterns and existing implementations
- Created init.sh for development environment setup
- Created build-progress.txt for tracking

Phase Summary:
- phase-1-landing-page: 3 subtasks - Enhance landing page with modern design
- phase-2-upload-enhancement: 3 subtasks - Improve file upload validation and error handling
- phase-3-runs-management: 3 subtasks - Enhance runs list and metadata display

- phase-8-final-integration: 3 subtasks - Final integration, documentation, and deployment verification

Services Involved:
- web: FastAPI web interface with Jinja2 templates

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 4
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups: phase-1, phase-2, phase-3, phase-6 can run in parallel; phase-4 and phase-5 can run in parallel
- Speedup estimate: 1.5x faster than sequential execution
