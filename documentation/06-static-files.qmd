# Static pages

## title page

If you have a static LaTeX title page, you can pass in 

```
titlepage: your_titlepage.tex
```
The file should contain only the TeX for the title page. Its contents will be input as follows
```
\begin{titlepage}
\input{your_titlepage.tex}
\end{titlepage}
```
Note because the `\input{}` call happens after the Pandoc template code is evaluated, this file must be a static tex file with no Pandoc meta variables.

## Cover page

Similarly, if you have a static LaTeX cover page, then pass in 

```
coverpage: your_coverpage.tex
```
The file should contain only the TeX for the title page. Its contents will be input as
```
\begin{titlepage}
\input{your_coverpage.tex}
\clearpage
... 
\end{titlepage}
```

## Static cover page and title page

In this case, another option is to pass in `none` for `titlepage` and `coverpage` and then pass in `titlepage-include.file`.

```
    titlepage-include-file:
      - your_coverpage.tex
      - your_titlepage.tex
```

## Copyright and dedication pages

You can include these as raw tex files. They appear after the title page. The [quarto_titlepages repository](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages) has examples of these pages in the `tex` folder. You can include as many raw tex files for your frontmatter as you need.

```
    titlepage-include-file:
      - tex/copyright.tex
      - tex/dedication.tex
```

A `\clearpage` command is issued after each tex file is input. To prevent page numbers, use `\thispagestyle{empty}` in the tex file.
