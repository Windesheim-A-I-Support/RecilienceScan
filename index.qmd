[quarto_titlepages](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages) is a Quarto extension for creating custom cover pages and title pages for PDF output. Pre-defined themes are available, but all themes can be customized.

LaTeX users who want to pass in their own title page or cover page files should see [quarto_titlepages_v1](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages_v1) which shows how to use Pandoc template files. Alternatively, see the [page](06-static-files.qmd) on passing in static title or cover page files.
